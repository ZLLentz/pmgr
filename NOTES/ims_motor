The weirdness for IMS motors is that we have some derived values:
	ERES = UREV / (4 * EL)
	MRES = UREV / (FREV * MS)

Now, FREV and MS are not really changeable (they are hardware parameters),
so we can solve the latter by saying that [MRES, UREV] is a mutual exclusion
set.

The situation is a little weirder for the first equation.
    - If you set UREV, ERES changes.
    - If you set ERES or EL, the other one changes.

So, we solve this by calling [ERES, EL] a mutual exclusion set, and ordering
writes:
    - UREV is first (setorder 1).
    - ERES and EL are later (setorder 2).
    - ERES is also "must write" (setorder is negative!).

So if we want EL to be the derived value:
    - We write UREV (which changes ERES).
    - We write ERES (which changes EL).
